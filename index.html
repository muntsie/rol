<wx-head>WELCOME COACH CARTER</wx-head><br>

<wx-text>Woods Cross Lacrosse Board is happy to announce the hiring of Shawn Carter as the new Wx Men’s Lacrosse Head Coach. Shawn will assume responsibility for our WxLax Program effective immediately. Coach Carter is well known for his great passion for the sport, skilled teaching and coaching capabilities as well as his coach-to-player communications. He truly cares about growing the sport, our program and especially our players! <br><br>

Coach Carter began playing Lacrosse at 14 yrs old. During his high school years, Shawn played with the Bountiful Men’s Lacrosse Program and went on to win the State Tournament in back to back years (2008-2009). Following graduation, Shawn joined the Utah Valley University Men’s Lacrosse and had the opportunity to play in the National Division 2 Championship. Most recently, Coach Carter’s devotion to the sport catapulted him into coaching with the Advantage Lacrosse and Team Six competitive programs as well as an Assistant Coaching position with Olympus High School.<br><br>
</wx-text>

<wx-head>A MESSAGE FROM COACH CARTER</wx-head><br>
<wx-text>I’m really excited to join the Wx Men’s Lacrosse Program and focus on the love of the game! The lessons that I learned as a player have been a staple in my life. We are going to be learning more than just how to play lacrosse. I hope we can work together to build up a strong program that focuses on the fundamentals and simplicity of the game.</wx-text>
